== Learn

NOTE: This repo is a part of https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code
Library], a collection of reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. If you've never used the Infrastructure as Code Library before, make sure to read https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library/[How to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library]!

=== Core concepts

* https://gruntwork.io/guides/kubernetes/how-to-deploy-production-grade-kubernetes-cluster-aws/#core_concepts[Kubernetes and EKS core concepts]: learn about Kubernetes architecture (control plane, worker nodes), access control (authentication, authorization), resources (pods, controllers, services, config, secrets), and more.
* https://training.gruntwork.io/eks[A crash course on EKS]: a series of training videos that teach you how to use EKS.
* _https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action[Kubernetes in Action]_: the best book we've found for getting up and running with Kubernetes.

=== Repo organization

* link:/modules[modules]: the main implementation code for this repo, broken down into multiple standalone, orthogonal submodules.
* link:/examples[examples]: This folder contains working examples of how to use the submodules.
* link:/test[test]: Automated tests for the modules and examples.

=== Gruntwork analysis

* link:https://www.gruntwork.io/example[Docker orchestration comparison: EKS vs ECS vs Nomad]: A detailed comparison off Docker orchestration tools, showing you the trade-offs between EKS, ECS, and Nomad.
* link:/_docs/faq.md#why-kubernetes[Why Kubernetes]: Learn why you may want to use Kubernetes in the first place.
* link:/_docs/faq.md#auth-to-eks[Why EKS]: Learn why you may want to use EKS to run a Kubernetes cluster.




== Deploy

=== Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples[examples folder]: The `examples` folder contains sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and testing (but not production usage).

=== Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

* https://gruntwork.io/guides/kubernetes/how-to-deploy-production-grade-kubernetes-cluster-aws/#deployment_walkthrough[How to deploy a production-grade Kubernetes cluster on AWS]: A step-by-step guide for deploying a production-grade EKS cluster on AWS using the code in this repo.
* https://github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-modules-multi-account-acme/tree/master/services/eks-cluster[eks-cluster in the Acme example Reference Architecture]: Production-ready sample code from the Acme Reference Architecture examples.




== Manage

=== Day-to-day operations

* link:/_docs/faq.md#auth-to-eks[How to authenticate to EKS]
* link:/_docs/faq.md#auth-to-eks[How to manage IAM roles and RBAC]
* link:/_docs/faq.md#auth-to-eks[How to deploy services on EKS]
